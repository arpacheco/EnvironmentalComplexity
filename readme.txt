This directory contains two executable MATLAB scripts used to generate the main data figures:

1. analyzeYield.m: processes OD600 growth data from 'com3', 'com4', and 'com13' experiments to analyze and plot biomass yields according to environmental complexity.

2. analyzeTaxonomy.m: processes 16s read data from 'com13' experiment to analyze and plot taxonomic diversity metrics.

Both scripts take in experimental data from the 'dataExperimental' directory, and both utilize simulated data from the 'dataComsumerResource' for epistasis comparisons. 

Scripts for running consumer resource simulations are located in the 'scriptsConsumerResource' directory.
